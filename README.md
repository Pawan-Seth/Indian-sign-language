# Indian-sign-language

Sign Languages are a set of languages that use predefined actions and movements to convey a message. These languages are primarily developed to aid deaf and other verbally challenged people. They use a simultaneous and precise combination of movement of hands, orientation of hands, hand shapes etc. Different regions have different sign languages like American Sign Language, Indian Sign Language etc. We focus on Indian Sign language in this project.

In this project, we aim towards analyzing and recognizing various alphabets from a database of sign images. Database consists of various images with each image clicked in different light condition with different hand orientation. With such a divergent data set, we are able to train our system to good levels and thus obtain good results.
